# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to find out how many employees are eligible for retirement given their title as well as the number of employees that are eligible for a mentorship program in order to prepare for the 'silver tsunami.' The project uses SQL in order to retrieve and format the data for presentation. 

## Results

### The Four Key Takeaways

1. In total, there are 72,458 employees that are eligible for retirement.

2. Based on job title, Senior Engineers have the highest # of employees that are eligible for retirement while only 2 managers are eligible.

3. There are 1,940 employees in total that are eligible for the mentorship program.

4. There are more senior positions to be filled (senior engineer and senior staff) than mid/entry level jobs. 

## Summary

There are 7 unique roles that need to be filled at the company: Senior Engineer, Senior Staff, Engineer, Staff, Technique Leader, Assistant Engineer, Manager. These 7 job titles cover the 72,458 employees that will be eligible for retirement. It is difficult to determine if all of these roles will need to be filled by external applicants as internal promotions may be factor for filling some of these titles. 

As it stands, there are currently 1,940 employees that are eligible for the mentorship program. Given all other factors are equal, this would mean that if every staff member that was eligible were to become mentors, each mentor would have roughly 37 mentees. If we factor in that some of these employees will receive a promotion that would aid the mentors but only marginally. It would be wise to either find more employees worthy of promotion or widen the criteria for eligible mentors in order to avoid problems of mismanagement or under-treatment for new employees. Overall, the company is unprepared for the impendent 'silver tsunami.'
